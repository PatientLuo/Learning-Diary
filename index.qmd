# Welcome! {.unnumbered}
Hi everyone! Iâ€™m Luo Huangchen, currently pursuing a masterâ€™s degree in Urban Spatial Science, with a focus on transportation planning, spatial data analysis, and remote sensing applications. I enjoy using data to tell stories and exploring new technologies to make cities smarter and more livable.
During my undergraduate years, I participated in various projects related to smart transportation, sustainable urban development, and traffic system optimization. Iâ€™ve worked extensively with tools like ArcGIS, Python, and R for data analysis. Recently, Iâ€™ve been researching mangrove and wetland conservation in the Greater Bay Area using remote sensing, which has been both challenging and exciting!
Beyond academics, I love traveling, photography, and trying new things. I often optimize SQL queries, simulate traffic flows with VISSIM, and conduct spatial analyses with GIS. Of course, I also take some time to relax by watching shows and unwinding. ðŸ˜†
Iâ€™m looking forward to connecting with like-minded people and exploring the fascinating world of cities together!
Iâ€™m really passionate about remote sensing, and Iâ€™m excited to learn and gain more knowledge in CASA0023. Iâ€™m looking forward to all the lectures and workshops!
