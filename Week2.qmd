## Week2

📢 Week 2: Creating PPTs with xaringan This week, we will be using xaringan, an R Markdown package, to create slides. xaringan allows us to build flexible, interactive, and beautifully styled presentations using simple Markdown syntax.

Throughout this week, I will explore how to: Set up a basic xaringan presentation, Customize themes and layouts, Integrate code, plots, and interactive elements

## Reflection

This week's assignment had me trying to create an online presentation using xaringan and hosting it on GitHub Pages. This was not only a process of presenting a remote sensing application, but also a new attempt to ‘think programmatically’. Compared with traditional PowerPoint, xaringan is more flexible and transparent, and I have a clearer understanding of the logical structure behind each slide. At the same time, through the integration of text, code and images in R Markdown, I felt the possibility of a natural flow between data visualisation and narrative.

From local editing in RStudio to online presentation in GitHub, each step made me understand the real need for ‘collaboration and reproducibility in research’. Although I had some problems debugging YAML and image paths at the beginning, solving them helped me to build a more complete understanding of the whole RStudio-GitHub-xaringan workflow.
