## Week2

📢 Week 2: Creating PPTs with xaringan This week, we will be using xaringan, an R Markdown package, to create slides. xaringan allows us to build flexible, interactive, and beautifully styled presentations using simple Markdown syntax. It’s a powerful tool for sharing research findings, data visualizations, and spatial analysis results in a professional and customizable way.

Throughout this week, we will explore how to: ✅ Set up a basic xaringan presentation ✅ Customize themes and layouts ✅ Integrate code, plots, and interactive elements

I’m excited to dive into this and see how we can make engaging presentations with xaringan! 🚀
