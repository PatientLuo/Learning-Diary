    "text": "2.1 Summary\nThis week‚Äôs course introduces the basic concepts and methods of remote sensing (Remote Sensing). Remote sensing refers to the technology of obtaining information about the Earth from a distance, usually with the help of sensors on platforms such as satellites, aircraft or drones (Campbell and Wynne 2011). We discussed in depth the difference between active and passive remote sensing: active remote sensing uses signals emitted by itself (e.g.¬†radar, lidar, etc.) and receives reflected information, while passive remote sensing relies on information reflected from sunlight hitting the surface, such as the Landsat and Sentinel satellites (Jensen 2009).\nRemote sensing data usually have four types of resolution: spatial resolution (pixel size), spectral resolution (number of detected bands), temporal resolution (revisit period) and radiometric resolution (sensitivity of detected spectra). These resolutions determine the application range and accuracy of remote sensing data. At the same time, the electromagnetic spectral signature (Spectral Signature) of the Earth‚Äôs surface enables remote sensing technology to effectively differentiate between different feature types, such as vegetation, water bodies, and soils. In addition, we discussed that the acquisition of remote sensing data may be affected by atmospheric conditions such as clouds and haze, which makes it necessary to ensure the quality and validity of data through atmospheric correction and other means (Schowengerdt 2007).",

    "section": "2.2 Applications",
    "text": "2.2 Applications\nRemote sensing technology has in fact long permeated every aspect of our lives, especially in the matter of responding to natural disasters, where its role is becoming increasingly important. For example, the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) in active remote sensing, which we mentioned in class, is particularly powerful in flood detection. Traditional optical satellites are easily blocked by clouds, but SAR is different, it can ‚Äòpenetrate‚Äô the clouds to monitor the ground conditions around the clock, so it is particularly useful in emergency situations such as floods (Amitrano et al. 2024). A recent reading also highlights that with climate change and increased urbanisation, flooding is becoming more frequent, making it vital to be able to identify and monitor flooded areas quickly and effectively, a need that SAR data meets, and one that can help governments to respond quickly and allocate resources for disaster relief(Twele et al. 2016).\n\n\n\nFig. 1 Three types of scattering of radar signals\n\n\nSource: Amitrano et al.¬†(2024)\nIn addition to flood monitoring, passive remote sensing data are also widely used, such as the Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellites that we often hear about, and their applications in agriculture and the ecological environment are particularly numerous. As an example, satellite data can be used to calculate the vegetation index (NDVI), which helps the agricultural sector to more accurately assess the growth of crops and predict yields, and can even monitor changes in the ecological environment in real time. Moreover, using cloud computing platforms such as Google Earth Engine, people can easily analyse large-scale land cover changes and even monitor global ecological trends (Gorelick et al. 2017; Zhu and Woodcock 2014).\n\n\n\nFigure 2 Schematic of the Google Earth Engine\n\n\nSource: Gorelick et al.¬†(2017)\nHowever, remote sensing is not a panacea, especially in cities and areas with vegetation cover, where SAR data can still be difficult to analyse. This is because buildings and vegetation in cities can cause complex signal reflections, making accurate identification of flooded areas tricky at times. Overall, however, the convenience and comprehensiveness provided by remote sensing data gives us more initiative in disaster response and environmental management, and the future development prospects are still worth looking forward to.",

    "text": "2.3 Reflection\nThe first week of remote sensing class made me realise right away that this technology is not just an abstract theory in the academic field, but a real tool that can make a difference in people‚Äôs lives. Of interest to me was the fact that active remote sensing (SAR), which we mentioned in class, has particularly prominent applications in natural disaster, especially flood monitoring. My previous understanding of remote sensing may have been limited to the simple application of satellite imagery, but I had no idea that it also has such great potential to address the risks associated with urbanisation and to protect people‚Äôs lives and property.\nAt the same time, I also noticed that although SAR can overcome the shortcomings of traditional optical images (such as the influence of cloud cover), there are still some challenges in its practical application. For example, the processing of SAR data in complex environments such as cities is still difficult, which reminds me that there are still quite a few practical problems to overcome between the development of the technology and the landing of the application. In addition, I am particularly interested in cloud platforms such as Google Earth Engine, which greatly reduces the threshold of remote sensing data analysis and allows us to quickly carry out large-scale environmental monitoring on a global scale, which is very attractive for both academic research and practical work.\nOne of the deepest feelings I got from this class is that remote sensing technology has really brought people closer to the Earth‚Äôs environment. Although there are still a lot of technical details that I need to learn in depth, I am already looking forward to what I can learn next and the role this knowledge can play in my future studies and career.\n\n\n\n\nAmitrano, Donato, Gerardo Di Martino, Alessio Di Simone, and Pasquale Imperatore. 2024. ‚ÄúFlood Detection with SAR: A Review of Techniques and Datasets.‚Äù Remote Sensing 16 (4): 656. https://doi.org/10.3390/rs16040656.\n\n\nCampbell, J.

    "text": "3.2 Summary\nThis week‚Äôs course took us on an in-depth exploration of important data correction methods and technical background in remote sensing data processing. First, we reviewed the history of the famous Landsat series of satellite data, with a special focus on the key contributions of technician Virginia Norwood, whose design of the digital multispectral scanner (Multispectral Scanner (MSS)) replaced the traditional analogue camera technique and drove a major change in remote sensing technology. Today, Norwood‚Äôs Whisk broom scanning technique is at the heart of remote sensing data acquisition.\nIn terms of data processing, we specifically learnt about three key methods, namely geometric correction, atmospheric correction and orthometric correction. Geometric correction addresses the spatial error between the satellite image and the actual geographic location by calibrating the image position through Ground Control Points (GCPs). Atmospheric correction deals with the data bias caused by the atmosphere, including relative correction (e.g.¬†dark object subtraction, pseudo-invariant feature method) and absolute correction (e.g.¬†FLAASH model) to ensure that the acquired data reflect the surface conditions more realistically. Orthometric corrections are used to correct image distortions caused by the angle of observation of the satellite, using mathematical models and surface elevation data to produce an accurate image as if viewed from directly above.\n\nSummary of Remote Sensing Data Corrections\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrection Method\nMain Purpose\nCommon Techniques\n\n\n\n\nGeometric Correction\nEnsures spatial accuracy of images\nGround Control Points (GCP)\n\n\nAtmospheric Correction\nRemoves atmospheric interference (clouds, haze, etc.)\n- Relative Correction: Dark Object Subtraction, Pseudo-Invariant Feature Method - Absolute Correction: FLAASH Model\n\n\nOrthorectification\nEliminates distortions caused by satellite viewing angles\nMathematical models, DEM-based corrections\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \nThrough this week‚Äôs study, I have gained a deep understanding of the complexity behind the process of remote sensing data processing, the seemingly tedious but very important steps that ensure the efficiency and accuracy of the data in scientific research and practical applications, and enable us to use remote sensing data more confidently in analyses and decision-making.",

    "section": "3.3 Application",
    "text": "3.3 Application\nAfter studying the remote sensing data correction techniques during the week, I purposely reviewed some examples of remote sensing correction applications in practical research, which helped me better understand the practical value of these methods. For example, in crop estimation studies, atmospheric correction techniques have a significant impact on the accuracy of vegetation indices. The accuracy of NDVI data can be significantly improved by accurate atmospheric correction, which can better monitor the true health of crops and thus help farmers to increase yields and reduce losses (Song et al. (2001)). In addition, some studies have also clearly pointed out that remote sensing data without correct geometric correction may lead to significant overestimation or underestimation of forest fire area (Roy et al. (2016)). Therefore, the importance of accurate geometric correction in the field of disaster management cannot be overstated.\nThe application of orthometric correction, on the other hand, reminds me of practical examples in urban planning. For example, in urban expansion studies, image distortion caused by satellite image tilting can seriously affect the accurate measurement of urban area, which can be effectively avoided after accurate ortho-correction, helping decision makers to grasp urban expansion trends more accurately (Lefebvre, Sannier, and Corpetti (2016)). This study used Sentinel-2 data to update the Copernicus High Resolution Impermeable Layer (HRL IMD), which improves the accuracy of urban change monitoring through remote sensing data fusion, as exemplified in the figure below which detects the changes in the city of Rennes for the years 2012-2015. This shows that orthorectification is not only applicable to traditional geographic studies, but also plays a crucial role in modern large-scale urban monitoring missions.\n\n\n\nUrban Change Detection in Rennes (2012-2015)\nSource: Lefebvre, Sannier and Corpetti (2016)\n\n\nThrough these application cases, I also began to think that although the methods we learnt in class are very mature, in practice, we still need to flexibly adjust the calibration strategy according to specific research scenarios. After all, disturbances in real environments are often more complex. This also inspired me to pay more attention to the flexibility and applicability of remote sensing methods in my future study and research.",

    "text": "3.4 Reflection\nThrough this week‚Äôs study, I deeply feel that remote sensing data processing is not simply a matter of ‚Äòtaking a picture‚Äô, but requires a lot of rigorous and detailed technical processing and correction steps behind it. In the past, I always thought that satellite images were just taken and used directly, but now I realise that this is just the beginning of the data processing journey. From data acquisition to real application, every step in between - be it geometric, atmospheric or orthometric correction - must be rigorously executed to ensure the accuracy and usability of the final data.\nI was struck by the fact that these seemingly complex and trivial steps all lead to a common goal: to ensure that we make the right decisions when facing environmental problems. For example, through accurate atmospheric corrections, we can obtain more accurate data on vegetation cover and thus plan for ecological protection more effectively. In addition, thinking about current technological developments, such as the increasing maturity of cloud computing platforms and automated processing technologies, I am also confident that in the future these data processing processes will become more streamlined and efficient, and our research and decision-making processes will become more reliable and timely. This anticipation of the future makes me even more enthusiastic and motivated for the subsequent courses and exploration of remote sensing technology.\n\n\n\n\nLefebvre, Antoine, Christophe Sannier, and Thomas Corpetti. 2016. ‚ÄúMonitoring Urban Areas with Sentinel-2A Data: Application to the Update of the Copernicus High Resolution Layer Imperviousness Degree.‚Äù Remote Sensing 8 (7): 606. https://doi.org/10.3390/rs8070606.\n\n\nRoy, David P, Luigi Boschetti, Christopher O Justice, and Jinzhong Ju. 2016. ‚ÄúThe Collection 5 MODIS Burned Area Product‚ÄîGlobal Evaluation by Comparison with the MODIS Active Fire Product.‚Äù Remote Sensing of Environment 112 (9): 3690‚Äì3707. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2008.05.013.\n\n\nSong, Conghe, Curtis E Woodcock, Karen C Seto, Mary P Lenney, and Scott A Macomber. 2001. ‚ÄúClassification and Change Detection Using Landsat TM Data: When and How to Correct Atmospheric Effects?‚Äù Remote Sensing of Environment 75 (2): 230‚Äì44. https://doi.org/10.1016/S0034-4257(00)00169-3.",
