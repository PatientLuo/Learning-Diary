# **Lecture 6** 

# **Summary: Classification in Remote Sensing**

## **Applications of Classified Data**

Classification techniques are widely used in **urban expansion, air pollution analysis, and environmental monitoring**.\
For example, **Landsat data** was used to analyze **urban expansion in Perth from 1990 to 2015**, demonstrating how classification methods can be applied to long-term **land use/land cover (LULC) change detection**.

-   **Forest monitoring and illegal logging detection**
    -   Environmental police in Brazil use **Landsat data and Google Earth Engine (GEE)**.\
    -   **Forest Watcher** helps detect illegal deforestation.\
    -   GEE enables **40-year Landsat imagery access** for large-scale classification.

## **Classification Techniques and Optimization**

### **Supervised vs. Unsupervised Classification**

-   **Supervised Classification**
    -   Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC)\
    -   Support Vector Machines (SVM)\
-   **Unsupervised Classification**
    -   k-means clustering\
    -   ISODATA method

### **Machine Learning Approaches**

-   **Decision Trees & Random Forests**
    -   CART (Classification and Regression Trees)\
    -   Random Forests (used in GEE for large-scale classification)\
-   **Google Earth Engine Optimization**
    -   **Avoid loops**; use `map()` for efficiency.\
    -   **Consider scale** when exporting classification results.

## **Challenges and Optimization**

-   **Overfitting**: Decision tree pruning and validation datasets can improve classification.\
-   **Mixed Pixels**: **Cluster busting** can refine classification accuracy.\
-   **Interactive Visualization**: GEE supports real-time classification parameter adjustments.

## **Final Thoughts**

This lecture reinforced how **GEE optimizes classification**, enabling large-scale remote sensing applications.
